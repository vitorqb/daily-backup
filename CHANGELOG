## [Unreleased]

### Added

  Because `mailgun` has a 25Mb limit on size, we now compress the file with tar and
  gzip before sending it by email.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-01

### Added

- Adds feature to cleanup local backup folder on every run.

- (__BREAKING__) The files are now stores with a `DAILY_BACKUP__` prefix. This means
  that if before we had `2020-04-23T07:58:03.tar.gz.gpg` now we have 
  `DAILY_BACKUP__2020-04-23T07:58:03.tar.gz.gpg`.
